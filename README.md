# TSR_Loader

## Description :  
This Launcher will start `Transformers2.exe` binary and modify it's memory so that it can run standalone without the original `Shell.exe` application.
The genuine `SERVICE` menu beeing hosted by the `Shell.exe`, it won't be accessible anymore, so a configurator tool to replace those settings is included in the loader package.
<br><br>

## Installation instructions :
1. Unzip `Transformers2_Launcher.exe` and `Transformers2_Configurator.exe` in the main game folder, where `Transformers2.exe` game file is located.
  
2. Run `Transformers2_Configurator.exe` and save changes you made.
  
3. Run `Transformers2_Launcher.exe` and enjoy the game!

## F.A.Q:
Q : Where can I find detailled explanations of the available options ?  
A : Look for the arcade cabinet user manual on Google, you'll easilly find them.

Q : I have issue starting the game  
A : Run `Transformers2_Launcher.exe -v` to generate a debug file that may help me find what is going wrong.
